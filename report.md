## 1. Consider the following state diagram:

(a) Which of the following strings are accepted by the machine?

    The strings shown in (ii) and (iv) are accepted.

(b) Describe as simply as possible the language accepted by the automaton.

    We can describe the language over the alphabet {0,1} in the following way:

    $$L=\{x\in\{0,1\}^*\mbox{ | }x \mbox{ は }3n-1\mbox{ で示せる数の}1\mbox{を含む }(n\mbox{ は}1\mbox{以上の整数 })\}$$
